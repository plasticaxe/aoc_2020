## Usage

This gem has no obvious usage besides my own testing at this point.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install all runtime and development dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

#### There is no target for release at this time, ignore the following...
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
